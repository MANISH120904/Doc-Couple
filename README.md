## 📖 Project Overview
**Doc Couple** is a proof-of-concept virtual influencer campaign featuring a hyper-realistic husband-and-wife team of medical professionals. The project demonstrates a cost-effective pipeline for pharmaceutical marketing, utilizing Generative AI to replace traditional actors and filming setups while maintaining strict character identity consistency across narrative-driven video content.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools

| Category | Tool/Platform | Model Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dataset Generation** | OpenArt | Flux.1 [dev] + Flux Context |
| **Model Training** | Civit.ai | Custom LoRA (Flux Architecture) |
| **Video Generation** | Google VideoFX | Google Veo 3.1 (Fast) |
| **Audio Synthesis** | ElevenLabs | Multilingual v2 |
| **Post-Production** | Canva | 
## ⚙️ Workflow Pipeline

### 1. Synthetic Dataset Creation
* Generated 15–30 high-fidelity images per character using **OpenArt**.
* Utilized **Flux.1 [dev]** with controlnets to vary poses, lighting, and emotions while retaining facial geometry.

### 2. Identity Locking (Fine-Tuning)
* Curated the dataset to remove artifacts.
* Trained a custom **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** model on **Civit.ai**.
* **Result:** Ability to generate the specific characters in any scenario (cooking, consulting) without identity loss.

### 3. Image-to-Video Animation
* Selected keyframes generated by the custom LoRA.
* Processed via **Google Veo 3.1** using Image-to-Video (I2V) prompting to dictate temporal actions (e.g., "sip coffee," "turn head").

### 4. Audio & Assembly
* Synthesized voiceovers using **ElevenLabs** to match character personas.
* Final composition, cuts, and overlay assembly in **Canva**.
